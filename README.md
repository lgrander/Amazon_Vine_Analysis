# Amazon_Vine_Analysis



## Overview

In this project we analyzed Amazon Vine review program in order to determine if there is a bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. The analysis focuses on Mobile Electronics and uses PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract data from AWS, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, load the transformed data into pgAdmin and calculate different metrics.

## Summary

From the results we can not conclude that paid reviews result in more positive reviews. Although there are no paid review less than 3 stars there is only a total of 4 reviews. Due to the small collection of paid reviews there are no real conclusions to be made. In order to reach a conclusion, we would need more paid reviews to conduct a proper analysis.
